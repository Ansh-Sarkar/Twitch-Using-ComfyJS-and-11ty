## Eleventy ( or 11ty )
Eleventy was created to be a JavaScript alternative to Jekyll. It’s zero-config by default but has flexible configuration options. It works with your project’s existing directory structure along with independent template engines. It dosen’t want to hold your content hostage. If you decide to use something else later, having your content decoupled via eleventy can make migrations easier. It also works with multiple template languages.
